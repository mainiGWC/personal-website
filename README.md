# EXAMPLE: Personal Site


## Project Requirements
Students' projects should:
- Have at least one HTML page for the website.
- Have all text on the page contained within appropriate HTML elements.
- Apply style to elements using CSS. As much as possible, try to apply styles using class and id selectors, rather than tag names.
- Use at least one implementation of Flexbox for layout.
- Address accessibility principles outlined by WAI. At the very least, images should contain alt captions.

## Extensions
Students can extend their site further by:
- Adding icons to the site using Font Awesome!
- Learning about BEM and use it in their HTML/CSS.
- Asking a classmate for constructive feedback on their CSS styling.
