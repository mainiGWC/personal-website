## Home 

- Hello, my name is Mansi Saini and I am a 14 year old from California learning to code. Through the Girls Who Code camp at Scripps College, I have learned to build multiple websites applying the skills I have learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From the home page, you can click on to the "About" page to learn more about me, the "Blog" page to find more about my experience in the Girls Who Code Camp at Scripps College, and the Portfolio page to see my coding portfolio so far. I hope you enjoy!

## About

- Hello! Prior to Girls Who Code, I had very little coding experience. I only knew how to do drag and drop coding, not actually typing the code. However, now, I am able to build a website using my HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills. As you can tell from my website, I learned a lot and really enjoy coding. Besides coding, I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, and meeting new people. I currently attend Beckman High School in Irvine. :)

## Blog

- On this page, you can see my reflections on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as journal entries from some of my coding projects.

## Portfolio

- Please feel free to check out my projects. One of my most recent projects was a personality quiz where I applied my knowledge of user interface design to create an asthetically pleasing layout along with the quiz questions. Another one of my projects was a collaboration of girl coders. We developed a website on the growing need for food throughout the world. I work closely with the Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, so being able to tie in one of my passions with computer science is amazing. I hope this website will inform others about cases of hunger across the globe and give insight on how they can assist directly in their community.
